Ancient Egypt,"Ancient Egypt was a civilization of ancient North Africa, concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River, situated in the place that is now the country Egypt. Ancient Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3100 BC with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under Menes . The history of ancient Egypt occurred as a series of stable kingdoms, separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods: the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age, the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age and the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age."
Nile River,"The Nile is a major north flowing river in northeastern Africa. It flows into the Mediterranean Sea. The longest river in Africa, it has historically been considered the longest river in the world. Its basin includes parts of Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Uganda, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Sudan, and the cultivated part of Egypt. The availability of water from the Nile throughout the year, combined with the area's high temperatures, makes possible intensive cultivation along its banks. "

Is the Global Liquidity Tide Turning,"The inflationary surge now hitting the U.S. is being felt in spades overseas. Countries that have linked their currencies to the dollar, either explicitly or de facto, are feeling the price effects of the greenback's slide in the past seven years. But as the credit crisis pushes the U.S. economy into recession, the process that pushed prices up abroad could go into rewind.  The U.S. current account provided a river of dollar liquidity to the rest of the world. For the most part, however, the process inflated the credit bubble."
The Raging Dollar Crisis,"The state Minister of Finance and the Secretary to the finance Ministry are out boasting about the increase of Dollar reserves from 2.8 billion at the end of July to 4 billion. This was solely due to the replenishment of quota for 780 million dollars from the IMF and loan facilities by Bangladesh and China worth 400 million dollars. How long will these reserves sustain the crumbling economy. Loans obtained from China will be spent back on Chinese vaccine Sinopharm which was bought at a very high price. Approximately 900-1000 million dollars of loan premium is due before the end of the year. Once spent on Petroleum, Coal, Medicine, Milk powder and Fertilizer, these reserves will be vanished before the end of the year. The only way forward is by accepting that there is a crisis. "

Bangladesh: The Land of Rivers,"Bangladesh is a small, lush country in South Asia; located on the Bay of Bengal. It is surrounded almost entirely by neighbouring India and shares a small border with Myanmar to its southeast, though it lies very close to Nepal, Bhutan, and China. The country is divided into three regions. Most of the country is dominated by the fertile Ganges Delta, the largest river delta in the world."
The Road Ahead for Africa,"Debt levels which were already elevated before the pandemic have increased sharply. Public debt in sub-Saharan Africa jumped by more than 6 percentage points to 58 percent of GDP in 2020, the highest level in almost two decades. The global fatality rate has fallen since the start of the pandemic, which in itself would put more countries in Africa above the global average. Africa is now facing the world's fastest growth rate for new COVID cases, with an exponential trajectory even more alarming than during the second wave in January. Countries across the continent, from South Africa, to Uganda and Rwanda are forced to reintroduce restrictions, further denting a precarious recovery."
